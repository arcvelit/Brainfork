# Brainfork
A Brainf*ck interpreter and compiler in C.

## How to use it
1. `cd src`
2. `.\make`
3. `.\Brainfork <option: -c or -i> program.bf`

## Notes
The interpreter allows in-text comments without the need of an indicator (#, //, etc.); write your comments wherever you want. Though, avoid using "." as punctuation...  
The interpreter will run and print the ouput of your program on the console. Compiling is on the way.
